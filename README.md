## Business understanding
**Objective**:
The primary business goal is to predict the operational status of waterpoints in Tanzania, classifying them into one of two categories:

1. Functional - Fully operational and providing water as intended.
2. Non-functional - Not operational and failing to provide water.

## *Why It Matters:*
1. *Efficient Resource Allocation:*
Predicting waterpoint conditions allows stakeholders (The Tanzanian Ministry of Water, NGOs) to allocate resources efficiently by prioritizing repairs and maintenance.
2. *Improved Accessibility to Water:*
Ensuring functional water points in rural and urban areas is crucial for providing clean water to communities, improving public health, and reducing waterborne diseases.
3. Cost Optimization:
Proactively predicting failures can prevent unnecessary repair costs, and funds can be channeled to more critical interventions.
4. *Sustainability:*
Understanding patterns in failures helps in better planning for future installations, improving waterpoint durability.

## *Key Stakeholders:*
- Government Agencies (Tanzanian Ministry of Water): Responsible for policy-making and infrastructure maintenance.
-NGOs and Charities: Focused on improving access to clean water.
-Local Communities: Beneficiaries of operational waterpoints.
-Donors and Funders: Interested in the impact of their investments in water infrastructure.

---

**Problem Description:**
The dataset provides various features that capture the physical attributes, installation details, geographic location, and usage patterns of the water points. These variables can help answer questions such as:

1. What factors contribute most to waterpoint failures?
2. Are certain geographic areas more prone to non-functional water points?
3. How do management and funding affect waterpoint longevity?
4. Can the age of a waterpoint (construction year) predict its condition?

## **Expected Outcome:**
A machine learning model that:
- Accurately predicts the operational status of a waterpoint.
- Key factors affecting functionality.
- Provides actionable insights for maintaining and repairing water points.

*Potential Challenges:*
a) Data Quality: Missing or inconsistent entries in key variables (e.g., funder, construction year).

b) Class Imbalance: If most water points are functional, predicting minority classes (e.g., non-functional) can be challenging.

c) Geographic and Temporal Variability: Different regions may have unique issues (e.g., drought, poor maintenance) that complicate predictions.

d) Interpretability: Translating complex model outputs into actionable insights for stakeholders.

*Key Deliverables:*
1. **Classification Model:** A robust algorithm to predict waterpoint status.
2. **Feature Analysis Report:** Insights into which factors most influence waterpoint conditions.
3. **Dashboard or Visualization Tools:** To enable stakeholders to view and act on predictions and insights.
